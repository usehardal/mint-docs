Sending custom events with Hardal Hardal Web SDK provides a flexible way to track custom events through the `hardal.track()` method.&#x20;

This guide will show you how to implement custom event tracking for different use cases.&#x20;

## Basic Event Tracking&#x20;

The simplest form of tracking is sending just an event name:&#x20;

```javascript
hardal.track("test_event")
```

<Tip>
  You can run this event both client and server-side&#x20;

## E-commerce Marketing Event Examples:

For e-commerce websites, you can track detailed purchase information:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript purchase
  hardal.track("purchase", {
    properties: {
      transaction_id: "T_12345",
      currency: "USD",
      value: 125.99,
      items: [{
        item_id: "SKU_12345",
        item_name: "Premium Blue Jeans",
        item_category: "Apparel",
        price: 70.99,
        quantity: 1
      }, {
        item_id: "SKU_67890",
        item_name: "Casual White T-Shirt",
        item_category: "Apparel",
        price: 25.99,
        quantity: 2
      }],
      shipping_info: {
        method: "express",
        cost: 15.00
      },
      payment_method: "credit_card"
    }
  });
  ```

  ```javascript view_item
  hardal.track("view_item", {
    properties: {
      transaction_id: "T_12345",
      currency: "USD",
      value: 125.99,
      items: [{
        item_id: "SKU_12345",
        item_name: "Premium Blue Jeans",
        item_category: "Apparel",
        price: 70.99,
        quantity: 1
      }, {
        item_id: "SKU_67890",
        item_name: "Casual White T-Shirt",
        item_category: "Apparel",
        price: 25.99,
        quantity: 2
      }],
      shipping_info: {
        method: "express",
        cost: 15.00
      },
      payment_method: "credit_card"
    }
  })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Gaming Events Examples:

For gaming applications, track player progress and interactions:

<CodeGroup>
  ```javascript level_complete
  hardal.track("level_complete", {
    properties: {
      player_id: "USER_789",
      game_id: "GAME_123",
      level_name: "Dragon's Lair",
      level_number: 5,
      score: 12500,
      time_spent: 345, // seconds
      achievements_unlocked: ["dragon_slayer", "speed_runner"],
      resources_collected: {
        gold: 1500,
        gems: 25,
        experience_points: 750
      },
      player_stats: {
        health: 85,
        mana: 65,
        strength: 120
      }
    }
  });
  ```
</CodeGroup>

## Server-Side Processing

When these events are sent to Hardal, they are automatically enriched with additional information as shown in the data schema:

### Server-generated distinct ID

Unique cookieless identifier generated for each session.

```javascript Example
hr_1734601539658_5080zh7of
```

<Tip>
  You can enable or disable the SDK from generating identifiers to ensure better compliance with marketing and analytics regulations, such as GDPR, KVKK, or other privacy standards.
</Tip>

### Page Information

Details about the current page.&#x20;

* **URL:** [https://example.com/products](https://example.com/products)

* **Path**: /products

* **Title:** Product Catalog

<Tip>
  You can enable or disable from SDK. with `autoPageView: True // False`
</Tip>

### Screen and browser details

Device and browser specifications

* **Resolution:** 1920x1080

* **Browser:** Chrome

* **Version:** 131.0.0.0

### Device type

Type of device being used (e.g., desktop, mobile, tablet)

### Timezone

User’s timezone

Example: `Europe/Istanbul`

### Timestamp&#x20;

Server event occurrence time

* `2024-12-19T09:45:39.659Z`

### Query parameters

Any URL query parameters, including UTMs.

```javascript
https://example.com/products?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=summer_sale&utm_term=discount&utm_content=header_banner&custom_param1=user_tier&custom_param2=region_europe
```

<Tip>
  You can include as many custom parameters as needed to custom your marketing and analytics goals, as long as they don’t conflict with reserved keywords like standard UTM parameters.
</Tip>

## Best Practices

1. **Consistent Naming**: Use snake\_case for event names and properties

2. **Structured Data**: Group related properties into nested objects

3. **Data Types**: Use appropriate data types (strings, numbers, booleans, arrays)

4. **Timestamp Handling**: Include timestamps for time-sensitive events

5. **Validation**: Verify all required properties are present before sending
