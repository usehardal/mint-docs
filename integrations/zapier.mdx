## Overview

Our Zapier integration allows you to connect your application with 3000+ apps and automate your workflows without writing any code. 

## Setting up Zapier

1. Visit the [Zapier Integration Page](https://zapier.com/apps/yourapp)
2. Click "Accept Invite" to get access to the integration
3. Create a new Zap and choose your application as the trigger or action


## Using the Data in Zapier

1. In Zapier, create a new Zap
2. Choose "Webhooks by Zapier" as your trigger app
3. Select "Catch Hook" as the trigger event
4. Use the provided webhook URL in your Hardal configuration
5. Test the connection to ensure data is flowing correctly

## Available Event Properties

Your Zapier actions will receive the following data from Hardal:

- `page_url`: The URL where the event occurred
- `page_title`: The title of the page
- `referrer`: The referring URL
- Additional custom properties based on your tracking setup

## Best Practices

- Test your webhook connection before setting up complex automation
- Set up error notifications in Zapier to monitor for failed webhook deliveries
- Consider adding custom filtering in Zapier to process only specific events
- Use Zapier's built-in formatting tools to transform the data as needed

## Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving data in Zapier:

1. Verify your webhook URL is correctly copied to Hardal
2. Ensure your Zap is turned on
3. Check that your Hardal events are being triggered
4. Verify the request format matches Zapier's expectations
