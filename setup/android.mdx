## Installation

Add this code to your Android project to initialize Hardal and start sending events:

<CodeGroup>
```kotlin
import org.json.JSONObject
import java.net.URL
import java.time.Instant
import javax.net.ssl.HttpsURLConnection

class HardalClient {
    private val endpoint = "https://<your-hardal-signal-id>-signal.usehardal.com"
    
    fun sendEvent(eventName: String, properties: Map<String, Any>) {
        Thread {
            try {
                val url = URL("https://<your-hardal-signal-id>-signal.usehardal.com/push/hardal")
                val connection = url.openConnection() as HttpsURLConnection
                
                connection.requestMethod = "POST"
                connection.setRequestProperty("Content-Type", "application/json")
                connection.doOutput = true
                
                val eventData = JSONObject().apply {
                    put("event", eventName)
                    put("properties", JSONObject(properties))
                    put("timestamp", Instant.now().toString())
                }
                
                connection.outputStream.use { os ->
                    os.write(eventData.toString().toByteArray())
                }
                
                val responseCode = connection.responseCode
                if (responseCode != HttpsURLConnection.HTTP_OK) {
                    println("Failed to send event: $responseCode")
                }
            } catch (e: Exception) {
                println("Error sending event: ${e.message}")
            }
        }.start()
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuration Options

For Android integration, you can customize the following:

- Custom event properties
- Event batching
- Retry logic for failed requests
- Background thread management

### Example Usage

```kotlin
// Initialize the client
val hardalClient = HardalClient()

// Track a custom event
hardalClient.sendEvent(
    eventName = "purchase_completed",
    properties = mapOf(
        "product_id" to "123",
        "price" to 99.99,
        "currency" to "USD"
    )
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not being received">
    Check the following:
    1. Network connectivity
    2. Correct endpoint URL configuration
    3. Valid event format in the request payload
    4. Internet permissions in AndroidManifest.xml
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Validation

To validate your Android integration:

1. Monitor Logcat in Android Studio
2. Use the Network Profiler to inspect requests
3. Check for successful HTTP responses (200 status code)
4. Verify events appear in your Hardal dashboard

<Tip>
  For development, you can enable detailed logging by setting the log level to VERBOSE in your application's debug configuration.
