## Installation

Add this code to your iOS project to initialize Hardal and start sending events:

<CodeGroup>
```swift
import Foundation

// Initialize the Hardal client
let hardalEndpoint = "https://<your-hardal-signal-id>-signal.usehardal.com"

// Send event data
func sendEvent(eventName: String, properties: [String: Any]) {
    guard let url = URL(string: "https://<your-hardal-signal-id>-signal.usehardal.com/push/hardal") else { return }
    
    let eventData: [String: Any] = [
        "event": eventName,
        "properties": properties,
        "timestamp": ISO8601DateFormatter().string(from: Date())
    ]
    
    var request = URLRequest(url: url)
    request.httpMethod = "POST"
    request.setValue("application/json", forHTTPHeaderField: "Content-Type")
    
    do {
        request.httpBody = try JSONSerialization.data(withJSONObject: eventData)
        
        URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: request) { data, response, error in
            if let error = error {
                print("Error sending event: \(error)")
            }
        }.resume()
    } catch {
        print("Error creating request: \(error)")
    }
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Configuration Options

For iOS integration, you can customize the following:

- Custom event properties
- Event batching
- Retry logic for failed requests

### Example Usage

```swift
// Track a custom event
sendEvent(
    eventName: "purchase_completed",
    properties: [
        "product_id": "123",
        "price": 99.99,
        "currency": "USD"
    ]
)
```

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Events not being received">
    Check the following:
    1. Network connectivity
    2. Correct endpoint URL configuration
    3. Valid event format in the request payload
    4. App Transport Security (ATS) settings
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Validation

To validate your iOS integration:

1. Use the debug console in Xcode
2. Monitor network requests in the debug navigator
3. Check for successful HTTP responses (200 status code)
4. Verify events appear in your Hardal dashboard

<Tip>
  Enable verbose logging in debug builds to get detailed information about event tracking and network requests.
